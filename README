Example code for "Web-scale computer vision using mapreduce for multimedia data mining"

Notes about these examples
- Goal: Ground the examples in the paper to actual implementations to improve understanding
- As similar in function to the paper as possible
- Variable names may differ if it improves readability (often the 'type' as it is more descriptive)
- These are not the implementations used for the performance tests as those mix C/Python, use more complex Python libraries, use the TypedBytes input format, etc.
- Portions of the algorithms may be 'mocked' out if their functionality is not of focus.

Requirements
[] python (2.6.5)
[] hadoopy (0.1)
[] numpy (1.3.0)
[] PIL (1.1.7)
[] cxfreeze (4.0.1)

Algorithms closely track those in the paper where possible.  Alternative implementations are provided that extend those in the paper and provide more efficient implementations.  The examples are all independent to make them easier to understand at the expense of duplicative code.  Variable names are chosen to be similar to the paper if possible (often using the Type as the variable name as it is more descriptive).  The implementations used for performance testing are written in C and Python and are not the ones matching the figures.
